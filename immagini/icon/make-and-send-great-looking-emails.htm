    <p>Built with designers in mind, you can create your email designs using your favorite tools and then import them into your account with the click of a mouse. We'll automatically move all your CSS inline for the best results in email clients like Gmail and Outlook.</p>
    <p>We don't impose any design restrictions, and you won't find any ugly 'powered by' logos or branding either. We hate that stuff!</p>

You tell us how to decide a winner, we&#8217;ll send the two options to a sample of your list and then automatically send the winner to everyone else.</p>
